There are many different audiences and variety of cloud and compute configurations.  As this is the case, the CSA has a diverse membership, a variety of research areas and a breadth of recommendations and guidelines.  In this chapter CSA topics include:

* About the CSA
* Guiding Principles
* History
* Research areas
* Membership
* Best ways to leverage CSA

## About the CSA

The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) is dedicated to defining and raising awareness of best practices to help ensure a secure cloud computing environment.  The CSA leverages the expertise of industry practitioners, associations and governments, corporations and individual members.  They offer research, education, certification, events, and products specific to cloud security that benefit the entire community.  They essentially provide a forum through which these different parties can work together to create and maintain these recommendations for a trusted cloud ecosystem. [@fa18-516-17-CSA-About]
The industry group also provides security education and offers guidance to companies in different stages of cloud adoption.  They also offer certification programs for cloud security providers and manage a global consulting program that allows participants to work with a network of qualified cloud security professionals. [@fa18-516-17-CSA-About]

## Guiding Principles

The Cloud Security Alliance members are united by the following objectives according to thier LinkedIn page: 

> * "Promote a common level of understanding between the consumers and providers of 
>   cloud computing regarding the necessary security requirements and attestation of assurance. 
> * Promote independent research into best practices for cloud computing security. 
> * Launch awareness campaigns and educational programs on the appropriate uses of cloud computing and cloud security solutions. 
> * Create consensus lists of issues and guidance for cloud security assurance." [@fa18-516-17-CSA-LinkedIn]

## History

The Cloud Security Alliance was forged due to the need to have to have security best practices in a cloud computing environment 
[@fa18-516-17-Messmer].  As the concept of cloud computing increased in popularity in 2008, so did the surrounding issues and opportunities.  The information security community took note and in November at an ISSA CISO Forum in Las Vegas the concept of the Cloud Security Alliance was born.  After acknowledging emerging trends, proactive participants outlined the initial mission and strategy of the CSA.   What followed was a series of meetings with industry leaders later that year which codified the foundation of CSA as we know it today. 

## Research Areas

The CSA currently has working groups that cover 38 domains of Cloud Security.  These working groups publish a variety of white papers, reports, tools, trainings, and services that benefit the cloud security community.
 
For instance, the Blockchain working group meets every other week to discuss current events that surround Blockchain and any potential security implication. In addition, they published multiple documents outlining successful Blockchain projects, how to use the technology to secure the Internet of Things and a reference glossary of terms for the industry’s benefit. 

## Membership

The Cloud Security Alliance employs roughly sixteen full-time and contract staff worldwide. It has over 400 active volunteers participating in research at any time. The CSA is a member-driven organization and individuals who are interested in cloud computing and have the experience to assist in making it more secure receive a complimentary individual membership based on a minimum level of participation.[@fa18-516-17-chapters]

The Cloud Security Alliance has a network of chapters worldwide. Chapters are separate legal entities from the Cloud Security Alliance, but operate within guidelines set down by the Cloud Security Alliance In the United States.
Chapters are encouraged to hold local meetings and participate in areas of research. Chapter activities are coordinated by the Cloud Security Alliance worldwide. [@fa18-516-17-chapters]

## Best ways to leverage CSA

### Security Guidance Publication

The Security Guidance for Critical Areas of Focus in Cloud Computing documentation provides guidance to support business goals while mitigating the risks associated with the adoption of cloud computing technology.  It is derived from focused research, participation from the Cloud Security Alliance members, working groups, and industry experts. It incorporates new cloud technology, reflects on real-world cloud security practices, integrates the latest Cloud Security Alliance research projects, and offers guidance for related technologies. [@fa18-516-17-guidance]

These security guidelines use NIST industry standards and are easy to read with models and illustrations that make key concepts more digestible for most readers.  

### Training and Certifications

#### CSA STAR 

This is an industry-recognized security assurance in the cloud. STAR encompasses key principles of transparency, rigorous auditing, and harmonization of standards.
According to the CSA website,
