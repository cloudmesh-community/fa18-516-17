## Introduction

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a platform discouraged by Retailers and hence not used by many Consumer Packaged Goods companies.  Project infrastructure revolves around using a non-AWS stack to pull Amazon items and reviews for analysis purposes.  It allows an individual to enter a set of product UPCs and understand where their opportunities are.

In order to do this we need to pull product, review and selling data off of Amazon Product Advertising and look for opportunities to sell more products.

## Introduction

One possible way of structuring the document.
We may have to tweak this example as we progress.

Make sure paragraphs are 80 chars wide 

Place images in an images directory

Use empty lines before and after headings

In [@vonLaszwski-fa18-sample-report] we can find a sample report.

Naturally the headings are just suggestions and you may change them as
appropriate for your project.

## Requirements

All images must be referred to in the text. The words bellow and above
must not be used in your paper for images, tables, and code.

+@fig:fromonetotheorther shows a nice figure exported from Powerpoint
to png. If you like you can use this as a basis for your drawings.

![A simple flow chart](images/from-one-to-the-other.png){#fig:fromonetotheorther}

Figures must not be cited with an explicit number, but automated
numbering must be used. Here is how we did it for this paper:

```
+@fig:fromonetotheorther shows a nice
figure exported from Powerpoint to png.
If you like you can use this as a basis
for your drawings.

![A simple flow chart](images/from-one-to-the-other.png){#fig:fromonetotheorther}
```

If the paper is copied form another source you MUST use a citation in the caption. 

![A simple flow chart [@vonLaszwski-fa18-sample-report]](images/from-one-to-the-other.png){#fig:fromonetotheorther}

This is done as follows

```
![A simple flow chart [@vonLaszwski-fa18-sample-report]](images/from-one-to-the-other.png){#fig:fromonetotheorther}
```
