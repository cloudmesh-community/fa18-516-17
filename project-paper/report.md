## Introduction


As with other industries, the retail industry today is undergoing a major shift.  Traditional brick and mortar stores used to relay on practiced merchandising techniques such as printed flyers, television advertising and low prices to drive traffic into stores.  Today, shoppers are electing for convenience more than ever before.  This is driving growth in a variety of time-saving Omni channel purchasing behaviors.  Shoppers are voting with their wallets for more product being shipped to their door or to their cars with grocery pick-up.
In tandem with a more demanding shopper there is also a fundamental shift in the sheer amount of data collected on the path taken to purchase products.  From the interaction to advertising campaigns, social media impact through research done online vs in-store, there is more data than ever available for retailers to leverage.

To survive, Retailers need to be open to change and use every advantage they have.  A fundamental element of developing their strategy is having a saleable cloud architecture to leverage the masses of data that they should be collecting about their shoppers.  The challenge is that as technology has evolved each retailer responded differently and implemented a piecemeal data strategy to accommodate data as it becomes available.  The challenge is to offer a cloud based highly scalable distributed architecture that will allow retailers to process the data a variety and integrate new data sets as they become available.

## Introduction

One possible way of structuring the document.
We may have to tweak this example as we progress.

Make sure paragraphs are 80 chars wide 

Place images in an images directory

Use empty lines before and after headings

In [@vonLaszwski-fa18-sample-report] we can find a sample report.

Naturally the headings are just suggestions and you may change them as
appropriate for your project.

## Requirements

All images must be referred to in the text. The words bellow and above
must not be used in your paper for images, tables, and code.

+@fig:fromonetotheorther shows a nice figure exported from Powerpoint
to png. If you like you can use this as a basis for your drawings.

![A simple flow chart](images/from-one-to-the-other.png){#fig:fromonetotheorther}

Figures must not be cited with an explicit number, but automated
numbering must be used. Here is how we did it for this paper:

```
+@fig:fromonetotheorther shows a nice
figure exported from Powerpoint to png.
If you like you can use this as a basis
for your drawings.

![A simple flow chart](images/from-one-to-the-other.png){#fig:fromonetotheorther}
```

If the paper is copied form another source you MUST use a citation in the caption. 

![A simple flow chart [@vonLaszwski-fa18-sample-report]](images/from-one-to-the-other.png){#fig:fromonetotheorther}

This is done as follows

```
![A simple flow chart [@vonLaszwski-fa18-sample-report]](images/from-one-to-the-other.png){#fig:fromonetotheorther}
```
